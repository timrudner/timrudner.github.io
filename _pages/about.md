The goal of my research is to develop methods and theoretical insights that enable the **safe deployment of machine learning systems** in safety-critical settings by drawing on tools from **probabilistic machine learning**. &nbsp; I am particularly interested in reliable uncertainty quantification in deep learning, robustness to distribution shifts, AI-assisted clinical decision-making and drug discovery, and AI safety.

**Bio:** I am a Data Science Assistant Professor, Faculty Fellow, and Instructor at New York University. Before joining New York University, I conducted PhD research on probabilistic machine learning in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, where I was advised by [Yarin Gal](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/yarin.gal) and [Yee Whye Teh](http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/teh). For my work on safe decision-making under uncertainty, I received the 2021 [Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship](https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/07/26/qualcomm-innovation-fellowship-europe-rewards-excellent-young-researchers). I care deeply about equitable access to education and was an [Equality, Diversity & Inclusion Fellow](https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/equality-and-diversity/mpls-ed-i-fellows) at the University of Oxford.

I am also an [AI Fellow](https://cset.georgetown.edu) at Georgetown's Center for Security & Emerging Technology and a [Rhodes Scholar](https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk/).

**Mentoring:** I was the first in my family to attend college, and I know that navigating higher education can be challenging for first-generation low-income students. If you identify as a first-generation low-income student and are looking for mentorship, please feel free to get in touch using [this form](https://forms.gle/DbHU2m5Ws7iVEjKi9).

**I am on the academic job market this year (2023-24).** Please feel free to reach out if you think I would be a good fit for your department.
