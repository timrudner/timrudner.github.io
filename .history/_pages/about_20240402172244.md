The goal of my research is to create **trustworthy machine learning models** with <nobr>a focus</nobr> on developing methods and theoretical insights that improve the **reliability**, **safety**, and **transparency** of machine learning systems deployed in safety-critical settings.
In pursuit of this goal, my research uses probabilistic methods to improve reliable uncertainty quantification [<a href="https://timrudner.com/fseb" target="_blank">1</a>,<a href="https://timrudner.com/uap" target="_blank">2</a>,<a href="https://timrudner.com/fsvi" target="_blank">3</a>], robustness to distribution shifts [<a href="https://timrudner.com/gap" target="_blank">1</a>,<a href="https://timrudner.com/plex" target="_blank">2</a>,<a href="https://timrudner.com/retina" target="_blank">3</a>], interpretability [<a href="https://timrudner.com/m2ib" target="_blank">1</a>,<a href="https://timrudner.com/fsmap" target="_blank">2</a>], and sequential decision-making [<a href="https://timrudner.com/odrl" target="_blank">1</a>,<a href="https://timrudner.com/sfsvi" target="_blank">2</a>,<a href="https://timrudner.com/rl-pathologies" target="_blank">3</a>], with an emphasis on problems in **healthcare** [<a href="https://timrudner.com/qsavi" target="_blank">1</a>,<a href="https://timrudner.com/nos" target="_blank">2</a>,<a href="https://timrudner.com/m2d2" target="_blank">3</a>].

**Bio:** I am a Data Science Assistant Professor, Faculty Fellow, and Instructor at New York University. Before joining New York University, I conducted PhD research on probabilistic machine learning in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Oxford, where I was advised by <a href="https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/yarin.gal" target="_blank"><nobr>Yarin Gal</nobr></a> and <a href="http://csml.stats.ox.ac.uk/people/teh" target="_blank">Yee Whye Teh</a>. For my work on safe decision-making under uncertainty, I received the 2021 <a href="https://www.qualcomm.com/news/releases/2021/07/26/qualcomm-innovation-fellowship-europe-rewards-excellent-young-researchers" target="_blank">Qualcomm Innovation Fellowship</a>. I care deeply about equitable access to education and was an <a href="https://www.mpls.ox.ac.uk/equality-and-diversity/mpls-ed-i-fellows" target="_blank">Equality, Diversity & Inclusion Fellow</a> at the University of Oxford.

I am also an <a href="https://cset.georgetown.edu" target="_blank">AI Fellow</a> at Georgetown's Center for Security & Emerging Technology and a <a href="https://www.rhodeshouse.ox.ac.uk" target="_blank">Rhodes Scholar</a>.

**Mentoring:** I was the first in my family to attend college, and I know that navigating higher education can be challenging for first-generation low-income students. If you identify as a first-generation low-income student and are looking for mentorship, please feel free to get in touch using <a href="https://forms.gle/DbHU2m5Ws7iVEjKi9" target="_blank">this form</a>.

**I am on the academic job market this year (2023-24).** Please feel free to reach out if you think I would be a good fit for your department. You can find my CV **<u><a href="https://timrudner.com/cv" target="_blank">here</a></u>**.
